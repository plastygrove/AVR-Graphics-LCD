Working code base for interfacing a JHD12864E Graphics LCD, DS1307 RTC and an ATMEGA1284P.

Not much documentation over here, but I will take the time to say if you're attempting something like this, make sure you're using a new breadboard and have some kind of insulation between the backside of the GLCD and the breadboard if you're using male header pins to connect the display directly to the breadboard. These precautions could have saved me two weeks of my life :(

I've written a tutorial on the entire process of interfacing a GLCD with a microcontroller on my blog at:
